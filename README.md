# React.js: Frontend V88 Bootcamp Assignments
This repository contains my completed assignments for the frontend track of the V88 Bootcamp, focusing on React.js. The assignments are organized to progressively build foundational skills, from handling state and events to working with APIs and building complex, multi-page applications.

### List of Assignments 
Each folder/branches in this repository represents a distinct assignment, demonstrating a specific React concept or functionality.

- `assignment/click` - A simple component that counts clicks, demonstrating basic state management using the useState hook.

- `assignment/contactlist` - A basic contact list application with a focus on rendering lists of components and passing data through props.

- `assignment/contactlistlocalstorage` - An extension of the contact list, adding functionality to persist data using the browser's localStorage API. This assignment showcases how to save and retrieve data to prevent loss on page refresh.

- `assignment/imageapi` - An application that fetches and displays images from an external API (e.g., Unsplash or Pexels). This project focuses on asynchronous data fetching using fetch or axios and managing the loading state.

- `assignment/lightsOnOff` - A simple component that toggles a light on and off, demonstrating how to conditionally render content based on a state variable.

- `assignment/moneybuttongame` - A game where users click a button to earn or lose money, providing practice with state management and event handling for interactive applications.

- `assignment/mypet` - A component to display information about a virtual pet, illustrating the use of props to customize a component's appearance and behavior.

- `assignment/onoff` - A basic toggle switch component, similar to lightsOnOff, reinforcing the concept of state-driven UI changes.

- `assignment/orderform` - A multi-step form for placing an order, demonstrating controlled components and form validation. This assignment highlights how to handle user input efficiently.

- `assignment/poolsurvey` - A survey form that collects data and displays the results, focusing on handling multiple form inputs and managing component state.

- `assignment/reaction` - A simple reaction timer or game, a great exercise for working with useEffect and handling timers in React.

- `assignment/router` - An application with multiple pages, demonstrating client-side routing using React Router. This is essential for building single-page applications (SPAs) with different views.

- `assignment/todolist` - A classic to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark items as complete. This project combines multiple core concepts, including state management, list rendering, and event handling.

- `assignment/youtubeclone` - A more advanced project that replicates some functionality of a YouTube video player, including fetching video data from an API and displaying a list of videos. This assignment combines API calls, state management, and component architecture.
